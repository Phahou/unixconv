# Finished:
 [x] dirs.c
 [x] list.c    added addhead() as another useful lib function
 [x] Tmsort.c  
 [x] idsort.c  implemented reduction
 [x] windows.c
 [x] ec.c      removed unused functions / simply stupid design choices

 [x] check if I can delete most the functions connected with reducedata()
     bc my refactoring in idsort.c-> msort kind of made it obsolete lol -> DONE!

 [x] config.c  removed -n option (not needed anymore)
 [x] tabs.c    deleted
 [x] io.c      Completly rewritten reducedata()

# Unfinished:
 [ ] options.c removed -c option

## TODO/NEXT: 
 [ ] line.c     removed calc_diff as it is in reducedata now
 [ ] README.txt rework so it looks nicer and stuff
 [ ] options.c  maybe put opt & cfg together bc it would seem the thing to do
